**Title: Heart as My Guide**  
---
**Verse 1**  
In a castle on the hillside, under silver moonlight beams,  
I would wander through the hallways, chasing my own dreams.  
With a map full of magic, and a torch that burns so bright,  
I step into the unknown, through the darkness, into light.

**Chorus**  
And I will keep on reaching, past the farthest star,  
Every hope I’m holding shows me who we are.  
Through the valleys deep and the skies so wide,  
I’ll follow this path with my heart as my guide.

**Verse 2**  
I found kindness in the journey, in the horse who came my way,  
He carried me through waters on that cold and windy day.  
Through the storms and the silence, I held my courage near,  
With the flowers of courage, every doubt disappeared.

**Chorus**  
And I will keep on reaching, past the farthest star,  
Every hope I’m holding shows me who we are.  
Through the valleys deep and the skies so wide,  
I’ll follow this path with my heart as my guide.

**Bridge**  
The treasure’s not in gold, it’s the hope I hold inside,  
It’s the voice that whispers softly when the night is still and quiet.  
I’ll carry it forever, through every path I see,  
A million dreams are burning bright in me.

**Final Chorus**  
And I will keep on reaching, past the farthest star,  
Every hope I’m holding shows me who we are.  
Through the valleys deep and the skies so wide,  
I’ll follow this path with my heart as my guide.
