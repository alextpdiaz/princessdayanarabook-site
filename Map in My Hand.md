Map in My Hand
**Verse 1**  
Yo, I’m in a castle, high towers, stone walls tight,  
Moonlight through the window, yeah, it’s my night.  
Found a map in the dust, says “Priceless Treasure,”  
Got a spark in my chest, can’t measure the pressure.  
Confidence lit, I’m ready to go,  
Courage in my pocket, yeah, watch me flow.  
Kingdom of Sagemont, path lookin’ long,  
Every step I take, I’m writin’ my song.

**Chorus**  
Map in my hand, I ain’t backin’ away,  
Through the dark, through the rain, I’ma find my way.  
Every candle I light, every fear I fight,  
I’m the queen of my story, yeah, I own this night.

**Verse 2**  
Horse showed up when the river ran deep,  
Could’ve quit right there, but dreams don’t sleep.  
Kindness fed him, he carried me through,  
Lesson learned — what you give comes back to you.  
Thunder crack, I fall, ankle feels weak,  
But I still push on, man, peak after peak.  
Flowers of healing, yeah, pain’s still real,  
But the heart keeps goin’, that’s the ultimate deal.

**Chorus**  
Map in my hand, I ain’t backin’ away,  
Through the dark, through the rain, I’ma find my way.  
Every candle I light, every fear I fight,  
I’m the queen of my story, yeah, I own this night.

**Bridge**  
Mirror in the cave, who’s starin’ back now?  
Not the girl who left, I’m the one who knows how.  
Treasure ain’t gold, it’s the fire inside,  
It’s the will to stand tall, yeah, the reason I ride.

**Final Chorus**  
Map in my hand, I ain’t backin’ away,  
Through the dark, through the rain, I’ma find my way.  
Every candle I light, every fear I fight,  
I’m the queen of my story, yeah, I own this night.
