## Lesson Sequences by Grade Band

### Kindergarten–Grade 1
- **Phonological Awareness:** Clap syllables in key words (Sa-ge-mont; cou-ra-ge). Identify initial sounds.
- **Concepts of Print:** Track text left-to-right; match spoken to printed words (projected captions or teacher-created excerpts).
- **Sequencing:** Provide picture cards (castle → flowers → horse → bridge → cave). Students order & retell.
- **Feelings & Faces:** Match Dayanara’s feelings to emoji cards; discuss body-language clues.
- **Centers:**
  - **Art:** Finger-paint “flowers of feelings.”
  - **Dramatic Play:** “Bridge crossing” with balance beam and affirmations.
  - **Word Work:** Magnetic letters build focus words (map, brave, help, kind).

### Grades 2–3
- **Character Traits with Evidence:** T-chart: Trait / Text Evidence (quote or picture detail).
- **Cause & Effect:** “Because Dayanara fed the horse → he helped her cross the stream.”
- **Compare/Contrast:** Another quest story or a fairy tale—how are the challenges similar/different?
- **Writing:** Narrative: *My Journey to a Priceless Treasure* (graphic organizer → draft → revise → publish).
- **SEL Meetings:** Weekly “Kindness Circle” where students share real examples.

### Grade 4
- **Symbolism & Theme:** Analyze flowers/candles as symbols; write paragraph using claim + evidence + reasoning.
- **Point of View:** Rewrite one scene from the horse’s perspective.
- **Opinion Writing:** Which value is most important for leaders? Cite 2–3 pieces of text evidence.
- **Media Literacy:** Evaluate how the cover art communicates genre and theme.

## Social-Emotional Learning Mini-Lessons
For each value (Confidence, Kindness, Determination, Courage, Wisdom):
1. **Define** in kid-friendly language.
2. **Find** it in the text (page/illustration).
3. **Discuss** a real-life scenario.
4. **Do** a quick practice (e.g., compliment chain for Kindness; calm breathing + mantra for Courage: “I can do this.”).
5. **Reflect** in journal (one sentence + drawing for K–1; paragraph for 2–4).

**Scenario Card Example (Courage):** “You’re nervous to speak in front of the class. What thoughts help you cross your ‘bridge’?”

---
## Cross-Curricular Extensions
**Art**
- Watercolor “Path of Flowers” (color meanings). Collage a mixed-media map.
- Design a bookplate or bookmark featuring one value.

**Music**
- Compose a simple class song (ABAB form) about Dayanara’s journey. Create rhythm patterns for each value.

**Science**
- **Light & Shadow Inquiry:** Use flashlights and paper cutouts to explore how light helps us navigate. Safety lesson: candles vs. electric lights.
- **Weather Mini-Lab:** Thunderstorm jar (safe water/vinegar/baking soda CO2 demo) to discuss weather; or simply chart storm safety.
- **Animals:** Nonfiction read on horse care; compare facts with the story’s depiction.

**Math**
- Count & Graph: number/styles of flowers; make a bar graph.
- Geometry: Identify shapes in castle/bridge illustrations; symmetry drawings.
- Measurement & Scale: Create a map with grid squares; estimate distances between landmarks.

**Social Studies**
- Map skills (compass rose, legend). Community helpers (who supports us on journeys?). Symbols and traditions (necklace of two hearts & infinity as family love).

**PE/Health**
- Obstacle “Journey Course”: stations labeled Confidence, Kindness, etc., with matching actions (e.g., balance beam = bridge; teamwork relay = kindness).
- Mindfulness: 1-minute “candle breath” (inhale count 4, exhale count 4).

**Technology/Media**
- Digital storybook in Google Slides/Canva. Record read-aloud with images (school policy permitting). Create QR codes linking to your class projects or the book website.
